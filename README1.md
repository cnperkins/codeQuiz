Name: codeQuiz

Description: This is a javascript coding quiz. When you open the html in the browser you will see the code quiz pop up. Clcik start to begin the quiz. You can choose an answer out of 4 answers. You will be alerted if it is correct or wrong. Then you can click next and move on to the next question. There is supposed to be a timer counting down from 60seconds to 0. Also with every wrong answer time would be taken away from the current time on the timer. But I was unable to get the timer to work. Also You can save your name or intials and the local storage will keep track of your username and score. However, I was not able to get the username to appear and it only shows as undefined.
